## Features

### Models & AI Components

Our application integrates multiple state-of-the-art AI models to deliver comprehensive image editing capabilities. The system includes DDColor for image colorization, Depth-Anything-V2 for depth estimation, MobileSAM for object segmentation, LaMa-Dilated for inpainting, CosXL for scene transfer, and MoonDream-v2 for image captioning. Each model is optimized for either on-device or cloud execution based on computational requirements.

**[View Detailed Documentation →](docs/models.md)**

---

### Compute Architecture

The application employs two distinct pipelines: Spatial Editing for lightweight on-device processing and Style Studio for high-fidelity cloud-assisted generation. The compute profile analysis covers model sizes, parameter counts, FLOPs estimation, and deployment strategies. Our architecture is designed to balance performance, memory footprint, and latency across different hardware configurations.

**[View Detailed Documentation →](docs/compute-profile.md)**

---

### Optimization Techniques

To achieve optimal performance on mobile devices, we've implemented various optimization strategies including quantization, pruning, and model compression. The Spatial Lighting pipeline maintains sub-10-second latency with a footprint under 350MB, while the COSXL Edit pipeline has been optimized to reduce GPU memory usage by ~50% through selective quantization.

**[View Detailed Documentation →](docs/optimization.md)**

---

### Training & Fine-tuning

We've fine-tuned SmolVLM-500M using LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation) for parameter-efficient training focused on understanding weather, lighting, style, and ambience variations in images. This enables sophisticated scene transfer capabilities where the model can extract semantic information from reference images and apply it to target images.

**[View Detailed Documentation →](docs/finetuning.md)**

---

### Privacy & Security

User privacy is a core priority. We've designed a comprehensive privacy architecture that includes confidential computing for cloud-based inference, ensuring that user data remains encrypted and isolated even during processing. The system implements zero-trust principles with hardware-based trusted execution environments (TEEs) for maximum security.

**[View Detailed Documentation →](docs/privacy-confidential-inference.md)**

---

### Ethics & Safety

Our application includes robust guard rails to prevent harmful or inappropriate content generation. We use Gemini API for content safety classification across 25 categories. Additionally, we've integrated blind watermarking technology using DWT-DCT-SVD algorithms to protect digital assets while maintaining visual quality.

**[View Detailed Documentation →](docs/ethics.md)**

---

### Performance Benchmarks

We've evaluated our style transfer pipeline against standard benchmarks, achieving a win rate of ~61.5% against ground truth stylizations. The evaluation uses automated assessment with Gemini 2.0 Flash, comparing generated outputs against reference implementations to ensure quality.

**[View Detailed Documentation →](docs/benchmarking.md)**

---

### Datasets

Our training data combines multiple Kaggle datasets focused on landscape imagery, day/night scenes, and weather conditions. We've created a curated dataset of ~5,700 images with carefully generated captions focusing on weather, ambience, and lighting characteristics using Gemini-2.5-flash-lite.

**[View Detailed Documentation →](docs/datasets.md)**

---

### Future Roadmap

Our hardware roadmap projects full on-device capability for all pipelines within 3-5 years through advances in semiconductor technology (2nm nodes), neural processing units (200+ TOPS), memory architecture (LPDDR6), and storage velocity (UFS 5.0). This evolution will enable real-time high-fidelity generation entirely on mobile devices.
